# FTC3113
GitHub repo for 3113 team work

For the team programmers follow these steps:

1. Create a folder on your desktop named "FTC work"
2. Open your terminal and type "cmd"
3. Navigate through the folders using "cd namefolder" to open the "namefolder" folder and "cd.." to move back to the previous folder in order to open the "FTC work" folder
4. Type on your terminal "git clone https://github.com/GabrieleTinelli/FTC3113.git" - this command will clone the whole Github repo on your computer to make you able to edit it
5. Open Android Studio and click on Open Project, then navigate up to the "FTC work" folder and choose it as project to open
6. Now you should be able to edit the code in the folder
7. Once you're done with the coding open again your terminal
8. Navigate up to our folder exactly as we did on point 3
9. Type "git add ."
10.Then you need to add a commit to explain your work in that code session. Type " git commit -m "TEXTOFTHECOMMIT" "
11.Finally type "git pull "

This workflow will send the Admin (in this moment Gabriel and Mac) a "Pull request" that can be accepted if it's useful to the programming work

Github will keep track of all of the pull request we'll have done in the repository in order to improve the maintainability of the code
